<br><br>
Fascinated by the alliance between visual aesthetics and the technical complexity of web development, I am looking for a work-study program of 4 days at work and 1 day of school per week.<br><br>
Coming from an artistic background, I naturally gravitated towards front-end development, but during my studies at Holberton School, my logical mind fell in love with back-end development.<br><br>
I like to take on technical challenges and my aspiration is to become the most complete developer possible, including data management, cybersecurity and deployment.<br><br>
I have a reputation for never giving up when faced with a problem and I remain focused in all circumstances.
